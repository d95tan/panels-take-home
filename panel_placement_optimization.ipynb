    "## Algorithm discussion\n",
    "During my [M.Arch thesis](https://www.ar-dan.com/what-the-farm), I used Rhino and Grasshopper to run simulations on building rooftops and facades - the general idea was to see if any slight rotations in buildings could lead to significantly more sunlight for vertical farming. The program used an evolutionary algorithm to return the ideal configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Doing something similar was my first thought when I saw the assignment, but thinking deeper about it, I don't think its the correct path to go down. The key differences was that the daylight simulations I had previously used were very computationally intensive, taking 3-5min per simulation, and I had about 5 buildings to rotate. Using an evolutionary algorithm meant that I didn't need to test all possible permutations, but could narrow down quickly and reduce computation time. Perhaps this is something that could be explored further in the future.\n",
