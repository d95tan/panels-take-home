    "## Algorithm discussion\n",
    "During my [M.Arch thesis](https://www.ar-dan.com/what-the-farm), I used Rhino and Grasshopper to run simulations on building rooftops and facades - the general idea was to see if any slight rotations in buildings could lead to significantly more sunlight for vertical farming. The program used an evolutionary algorithm to return the ideal configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Doing something similar was my first thought when I saw the assignment, but thinking deeper about it, I don't think its the correct path to go down. The key differences was that the daylight simulations I had previously used were very computationally intensive, taking 3-5min per simulation, and I had about 5 buildings to rotate. Using an evolutionary algorithm meant that I didn't need to test all possible permutations, but could narrow down quickly and reduce computation time. Perhaps this is something that could be explored further in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, since one of the assignment's objective is to assess the quality of my thought process, I will work to develop my algorithm rather than just plugging the data into an already developed algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "My first instinct was that I should start without rotation, and just differing panel sizes. However, after more time spent thinking about the problem, my hypothesis (and what I will build my algorithm off) is that:\n",
    "- The **rotation will actually have the largest impact on coverage** (may not apply to all cases, will discuss my assumptions later). \n",
    "- Choose the best rotation (perhaps include more rotation values if the preliminary results are close)\n",

    "- Instead of rotating the solar panels itself (which will make keeping the aligned rows and columns difficult), we can simply <u>rotate the roof</u> to achieve the same result. Thus, the solar panels will always be aligned orthogonally. \n",
    "- Instead of testing rotation based on a fixed \"step\" (e.g testing in increments of 5 degrees), my instinct tells me that the best orientations would be when at least <u>1 edge is at 0 degrees</u>. \n",
